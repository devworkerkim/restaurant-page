# Restaurant Page

This is the repo for the restaurant page project in the JavaScript course of The Odin Project

## Project

Building off of the objected oriented programming concepts from the earlier lessons and projects, the restaurant page project involved building from scratch a restaurant page that rendered a home page, a menu page, and a contact page through the use of JavaScript and in particular Webpack.  The concept of this project was to use Webpack to help organize our modules that rendered each page such that everything is generated through JavaScript.

## What I Learned

On all of my work up to this point I have mostly avoided any tools, frameworks, or extensions.  Yes, it's a bit rough but my thought is to learn the fundamentals so I don't get caught in a situation where I can't solve a problem because a tool abstracted the code out.  This isn't to say that down the road I won't be using tools since they were built to help developers scale their projects and workloads.  I haven't encountered a situation like that yet, so it hasn't been a priority to know the tools.  This was my first experience working with Webpack.

### Webpack

I kept on hearing about Webpack and how great it is, but this was my first expereiences with Webpack.  I guess `create-react-app` also uses it, but this has been abstracted into the workflow.  The previous lessons before the project had me step through the tutorials from the Webpack guides.  There's a lot of functionality in Webpack and it sets everything up for deploying a front-end app.  Because I hadn't learned about bundlers like Webpack, I would have to handle each individual file.  While this provides a sense of control and a means to fine-tune all aspects of the app, I can see how Webpack helps if the control isn't necessary and a project becomes significantly large.

### Rendering Through JavaScript

I usually have everything laid out in the HTML before I start using JavaScript to make the site interactive.  Having the app render the HTML through JavaScript has been a different experience for me.  I think I have the process down.

1. Create the node
2. Configure the node
3. Append the node

While this is something I know how to do now, I'm torn about calling HTML elements through JavaScript.  While it's convenient to have everything written in the JavaScript files, I feel like it defeats the purpose of having HTML in the first place.  Perhaps I'm okay with JavaScript having this power since it does need it for interactivity, but I think I disagree with using it on first renders.

### Modules

I had always wanted to know how to make my code more reusable.  Some of my side projects seem to blur together, but all I did was just cut and paste the code from one project to another.  Or I end up repeating my research and writing the same thing I wrote previously.  I had handled modules in a NodeJS project I was working on, but I was just following the syntax that I found without any real understanding.  I feel better about importing and exporting modules.  These projects have been great hands-on experience because it's forcing me to see, feel, and create these modules for use.
